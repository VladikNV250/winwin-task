## What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Filter Data via API**

- The filter data is fetched via the `getFilters` function, which simulates an API call using the `filterData.json`.
- Data is typed using the provided `FilterItem` type.

---

### 2. **Filter Modal UI**

- The modal window was implemented based on the provided Figma design.
- Layout and spacing were aligned closely with the design; minor inconsistencies were normalized for visual consistency.
- The modal opens from a button located on the homepage.

---

### 3. **Pre-filled Filter Selection**

- When opening the modal, previously selected filter values are automatically loaded from global state (`zustand`) and displayed as selected.

---

### 4. **Editing Filters**

- Users can check/uncheck filter options.
- All interactions update a local copy of the selection, allowing changes to be reviewed before applying.

---

### 5. **Apply & Confirmation**

- When the user clicks “Apply,” a confirmation modal is displayed.
  - If confirmed, changes are saved to global state.
  - If canceled, previous state is restored and new changes are discarded.

---

### 6. **Display Selected Filters**

- Selected filters are shown on the homepage in raw JSON format.
- This is included for visibility/debugging, as required in the task.

---

### 7. **State Management**

- Global state is handled via `zustand`.
- Local state (within the modal) is managed with `Map` + `useState` for performance and clarity.
- A helper function normalizes this local state into the expected `SearchRequestFilter` format when applying.

---

### 8. **GitHub Actions**

- A GitHub Action pipeline is included (e.g. `pipeline.yml`) to automatically check the codebase on commit or pull request.

---

## Notes(!)

- "Clear all filters" functionality was **not implemented**, as it was not mentioned in the task description.
- Also I forget to copy of the reposit

## How to set up the project

All scripts described below (except for _**dependency installation**_) can be used with pnpm instead of npm. They work the same way

### Installing dependencies

After downloading the project's source code, you need to install the dependencies. To do this, you can use the following command:

```shell
pnpm i
# or
pnpm install
```

### Run

To start the project for development, use the script `dev`:

```shell
npm run dev
```

This script automatically refreshes the page after you make changes in the code and works quickly with `vite`.

### Build

To compile the project, use the script `build`:

```shell
npm run build
```

After executing this script, you will have a folder `dist` in which the project's output files will be located, which can be uploaded to hosting.

Also, to see how the compiled version of the program looks, you can use the script `preview`.

```shell
npm run preview
```
